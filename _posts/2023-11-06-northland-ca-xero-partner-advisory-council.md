Nortland CA Director Mere has been appointed to the Xero Partner Advisory Council Aotearoa, New Zealand. (XPAC)

She says:

> The XPAC team is a core part of the Xero ecosystem, playing a crucial role as a consultative group of industry experts who provide real-time, real life feedback on behalf of the industry to drive meaningful change.
As an accountant I always champion hashtag#smallbusiness and it’s  fantastic to be given another platform to fight the good fight for them.
I’m on XPAC for the next two years and honoured to have the opportunity to make a real impact.
