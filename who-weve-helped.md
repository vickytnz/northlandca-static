“It was a big decision to go into Accounting software & it was important to have someone local who could help. Mere offered us Xero and we have never looked back. Thanks Mere for showing us Xero and all the help you have to give us non accounting people in today’s complicated world of finance.”
Ray Palmer - Whangarei Steam and Model Railway club

“Mere was fantastic with navigating us through the set up of our new farming business. She took our 'shoebox of receipts' and identified incomes and outgoings that we were not even aware of. She really went the extra mile in helping us claim major tax breaks and benefits we would have otherwise missed. We really appreciated how approachable and knowledgeable she was. Thank you Mere, we really valued your input.”
